<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Guillermo Barzana. I hold a Master's degree in Taxation and
  a Bachelor's degree in Accounting, and I am a Certified Public Accountant
  (CPA) in the state of Florida (license not active). With more than 35 years of
  experience in both private and public accounting, I've accumulated a wealth of
  knowledge and expertise in the field.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my extensive career, I have been dedicated to helping businesses
  and individuals navigate the complexities of financial management and
  compliance. Now retired from traditional accounting roles, I have decided to
  embark on an exciting new journey as a full-stack web developer. My goal is to
  leverage my deep understanding of auditing and accounting to create
  innovative, cloud-based audit software.
</p>
<p>
  This software is designed to streamline the audit process, making it more
  efficient and accessible. Whether performing single audits or program-specific
  audits, my solution aims to provide comprehensive tools and features to meet
  the diverse needs of auditing professionals.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to contributing to the future
  of auditing with modern, technology-driven solutions.
